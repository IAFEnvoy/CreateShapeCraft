This is a mod around shapes, which allows you to process and create shapes.

This mod is inspired by the game [ShapeZ](https://shapez.io/).

Shape is the basic unit for processing.

Each shape have a unique key which is same with ones in ShapeZ. You can use [Shape Generator](https://viewer.shapez.io/)
to create and view shapes. In-game you can use `/shape <key>` to grant specific shape (Creative only).
